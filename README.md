# Hand Gesture Controlled Robot 

A robot controlled via human hand gestures using an accelerometer and Arduino Uno. The system uses an RF module for wireless data transmission between a wearable hand glove and a robotic vehicle.

##  Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- RF 433 MHz Transmitter & Receiver
- ADXL335 Accelerometer
- L293D Motor Driver IC
- 9V Battery
- DC Motors
- Car Chassis
- Jumper Wires

##  Working Principle
- Accelerometer captures hand gestures (tilt)
- Arduino processes the gesture data
- RF module transmits the data wirelessly
- Receiver receives data and moves the robot accordingly


##  Applications
- Assisting physically disabled individuals
- Wireless gesture-based wheelchair
- Surveillance and military robots
- Industrial robotic arms

##  Future Scope
- Integrate camera or Bluetooth
- Gesture-based wheelchair with path following
- Real-time hand tracking using AI
